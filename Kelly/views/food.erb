All three of us loves Mike's Pastry, all of the desserts are delicious and they are not too expensive. Desserts are about $3.50 each which is not too bad. Also it is important to know that the servings at Mike's Pastry are quite large so 2 people can easily share a dessert</p>

  <p>Flour Bakery is a great, classic cafe. They are a French-style bakery specializing in croissants, sticky buns and french pastries! If you are not a fan of junk food or you are on a diet Flour bakery is the place for you! The bakery also has a healthy option to their menu. Their "specialty" menu consist of whole wheat granola, currant spelt oat scone e.t.c. Flour Bakery is your typical cafe/bakery so we would recommend it to everybody who love cafe food.
