<p>  Although Boston has many great shopping centers, one charm of the New England City is finding many of the small shops that are located all around the city.
  Many of these shops don't have websites so it can be hard to find them, but the adorbale boutuques are a great aspect of Boston to look for while you are walking around the Scenic town.</p>
