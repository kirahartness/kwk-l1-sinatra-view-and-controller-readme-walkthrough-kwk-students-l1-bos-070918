   <p>This is The Boston Common. This gorgeous park in the center of Boston is a great spot for taking a stroll, walking a dog, or even a picnic. The 50 acre public park is arguably the heart of Boston, due to its central location as well as the popularity of the park. The park has a couple historically monuments, in addition to the Swan Boats, which is a fun ride around the common that anyone would enjoy.Even if you are coming for a day trip, make sure to go to the park!</p>
